# mandelbrot_and_markov

This project contains two Python scripts, each of which returns: <br />
__mandelbrot.py__: the plot of the Mandelbrot set in the range [-2, 1]x[-1.5i, 1.5i] <br />
__markov_chain.py__: the difference between the current state vector and the eigenvector with corresponding eigenvalue = 1 through N iterations in a random Markov chain <br />

In order for everything to work appropriately, please download all files into the same folder. Open the terminal and cd to this directory. From here, the files can be called by running:

'''
python3 file_name.py
'''

To change the function variables, edit the function call on the last line of each script.
